# ðŸ¦  Pandemic Preparedness Analysis: Avian Flu Post-SARS

This repository contains R scripts and data to measure **pandemic preparedness** across countries, focusing on avian flu outbreaks after the SARS epidemic. The analysis uses a **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** framework, specifically the **TOPSIS** (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method, to rank countries based on multiple preparedness factors.

## ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**
This project evaluates pandemic preparedness using a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors, including:

- **Surveillance Score:** Evaluates reporting time, testing access, genome sharing, and contact tracing.
- **Hospital Beds per Capita:** Measures healthcare capacity.
- **GDP Trends:** Reflects economic resilience.
- **Health Expenditure as % of GDP:** Assesses financial commitment to healthcare.
- **Type of Government:** Encodes federal cohesion as an ordinal variable.
- **Poultry Production Trends:** Indicates potential zoonotic risk.
- **Incidence of SARS and Avian Flu:** Tracks historical pandemic responses.
- **Reported Avian Flu in Animals:** Monitors zoonotic transmission patterns.
